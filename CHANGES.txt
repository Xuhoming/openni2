  - PS1080 Bug Fix: handle file system lock when uploading only in supporting firmwares
  - PS1080: Add NESA unlimited to BIST
  - PS1080: improved hardware name detection
  - PS1080: IR stream now also supports RGB888
  - Bug Fix: Visual Sutdio 2008 wasn't supported
  - Add a typedef: OniGrayscale8Pixel
  - Make sure device is still open when closing a stream that uses it.
  - Add support for Capri devices
  - New Java Wrappers
  - New Java sample: SimpleViewer.java
  - Support WIX 3.6 and up
  - Kinect: wrong error code returned when trying to change video mode while streaming
  - invoke() method signature was updated - data is no longer const
  - PrimeSense: move common properties (PS1080 and Capri) to PrimeSense.h
  - PS1080: add new property for turning on hardware frame sync, with no OpenNI checks
  - New pixel format: YUYV. PS1080 now supports it (on newer firmwares)
  - PS1080: add lots of debug commands
  - ReleaseVersion script: don't fail if output file exists (overwrite it)
  - PS1080: add new file type (vendor data)

OpenNI 2.1.0:
  - API change: each event now has its own addListener()/removeListener() methods. A listener object can now be added only once.
  - Support for Mac OSX
  - Support for Linux on Arm
  - Support for Android (native only)
  - Kinect: implementing convertDepthToColorCoordinates()
  - Kinect: implementing CameraSettings
  - Kinect Bug Fix: can now switch between color and IR streams
  - Kinect Bug Fix: wrong mirror value was returned
  - PS1080 Bug Fix: trying to open more than 8 devices will crash
  - PS1080 Bug Fix: on Linux 64-bit, color frames are sometimes corrupt
  - PS1080 Bug Fix: a potential crash with older firmwares
  - NiViewer now browses whenever a recording is started
  - NiViewer: added 'i' key for toggling image-registration (also added current status in the status bar)
  - Minor memory leak fixes
  - EventBasedRead Sample Bug Fix: will not get device events
  - EventBasedRead Sample now prints the list of connected devices and every change that occurs
  - Recordings are now also compatible with OpenNI 1.x and NiTE 1.x
  - Potential starvation bug fix when application takes much time handling events
  - Log file now closes on shutdown(), and a new one is created on initialize()
  - SimpleRead is now the default project in the VS solution (thanks eranws)
  - Bug Fix: did not support Visual Studio 2008 and older
  - Bug Fix: did not support Visual Studio 2012 and newer
  - Bug Fix: did not support Visual Studio Express (thanks rh-galaxy)
  - NiViewer Bug Fix: Mirror did not change IR state
  - Kinect: providing Kinect for Windows PID and VID in the device info struct
  - ONI files: providing driver name in the device info struct
  - Bug Fix: ReleaseVersion script did not work on 32-bit machines
  - Linux Bug Fix: log timestamps did not start from 0.
  
OpenNI 2.0.0:
  - Brand new API (see documentation)
  - Algorithms API were removed, and are now part of middleware libraries (such as NiTE)
  - New deployment model - private copy to each application (see documentation)
  - Added support for turning off Auto Exposure and Auto White Balance of the color CMOS in PS1080 devices
  - Built-in support for Kinect devices via the Kinect SDK (Windows only)
  - Added support for translating a depth pixel to color map coordinates
